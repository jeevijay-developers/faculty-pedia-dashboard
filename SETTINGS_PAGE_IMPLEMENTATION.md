   - Validates input data
   - Sends update request to backend
   - Shows loading state on button
   - Displays success/error toast notification
   - Keeps form populated with updated data

#### State Management
```typescript
const [educatorId, setEducatorId] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [fetchingData, setFetchingData] = useState(true);
const [profileImage, setProfileImage] = useState("");
const [profileData, setProfileData] = useState({...});
const [workExperience, setWorkExperience] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [qualifications, setQualifications] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [socialLinks, setSocialLinks] = useState({...});
```
