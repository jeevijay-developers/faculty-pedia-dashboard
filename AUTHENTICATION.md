# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated authentication system for the Faculty Pedia educator dashboard with protected routes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Login Page Integration (`components/login-page.tsx`)
- ✅ Integrated with `loginEducator` API from `util/server.js`
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Loading states during authentication
- ✅ Token and educator data storage in localStorage
- ✅ Automatic redirect to dashboard on successful login
- ✅ Prevents authenticated users from accessing login page

### 2. Authentication Context (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
- ✅ Created global auth state management
- ✅ `AuthProvider` component wrapping the entire app
- ✅ `useAuth` hook for accessing auth state anywhere
- ✅ Login and logout functions
- ✅ Automatic authentication check on app load
- ✅ Stores: educator data, token, and authentication status

### 3. Protected Routes (`components/protected-route.tsx`)
- ✅ Component that wraps protected pages
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
- ✅ Shows loading state while checking authentication
- ✅ Prevents rendering of protected content until auth is verified

### 4. Dashboard Protection (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Wrapped entire dashboard with `ProtectedRoute`
- ✅ All dashboard routes now require authentication
- ✅ Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated

### 5. Root Layout Updates (`app/layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `AuthProvider` to wrap entire application
- ✅ Makes auth context available everywhere

### 6. Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Changed from redirect to showing login page
- ✅ Entry point for unauthenticated users

### 7. Sidebar Enhancements (`components/dashboard-sidebar.tsx`)
- ✅ Displays logged-in educator's name and email
- ✅ Shows educator's initial in avatar
- ✅ Added logout button with confirmation
- ✅ Logout clears all stored data and redirects to home

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User visits root page (`/`) and sees login form
2. User enters email and password
3. Form submits to `loginEducator` API
4. On success:
   - Token saved to localStorage
   - Educator data saved to localStorage
   - Auth context updated
   - Automatic redirect to `/dashboard`
5. On error:
   - Error message displayed to user
   - Form remains accessible for retry

### Protected Dashboard Access
1. User tries to access `/dashboard` or any sub-route
2. `ProtectedRoute` checks authentication status
3. If authenticated: Content renders normally
4. If not authenticated: Redirect to login page
5. Shows loading spinner during check

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout button in sidebar
2. `logout()` function called from auth context
3. Clears all localStorage data:
   - `faculty-pedia-auth-token`
   - `faculty-pedia-educator-data`
   - `user-role`
4. Redirects to home page (`/`)

## API Integration
- Uses existing `API_CLIENT` from `util/config.js`
- Token automatically attached to all requests via interceptor
- 401 errors trigger logout and redirect to login

## Security Features
- ✅ Client-side route protection
- ✅ Token stored in localStorage
- ✅ Token sent with all API requests
- ✅ Automatic token refresh on page load
- ✅ Session expiry handling via API interceptor
- ✅ Logout clears all sensitive data

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Authentication context
- `components/protected-route.tsx` - Route protection component
- `AUTHENTICATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `components/login-page.tsx` - Added API integration
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider
- `app/page.tsx` - Changed to show login
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Added route protection
- `components/dashboard-sidebar.tsx` - Added logout and user info

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Login:
1. Start the backend server (should be running on localhost:4000)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Enter educator credentials
4. Should redirect to dashboard on success

### Test Protection:
1. Without logging in, try accessing `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. Should redirect to login page

### Test Logout:
1. After logging in, click logout button in sidebar
2. Should clear session and redirect to home
3. Try accessing dashboard - should redirect to login

## Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000  # or your production URL
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Add "Remember Me" functionality
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Add session timeout warnings
- [ ] Server-side route protection with Next.js middleware
- [ ] Add loading skeleton for dashboard
